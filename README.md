### Hi i'm keith
I like mathematics. Sometimes we do programming in mathematics and sometimes they do mathematics in programming.

THINGS I HAVE:
 - a family
 - a dog
 - covid-19
 - nonfiction books
 - VirtualBox for Windows running Ubuntu 18.04.06
 - a soul (?)
 - not a house

THINGS I DO:
 - breathing (when appropriate)
 - sleeping
 - a little dance
 - a slightly larger dance (in moderation)
 - knowing
 
 I want to learn how linux and C++ work so that my friends can stop judging me for programming in python on windows
